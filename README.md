# PHP Glow library

This PHP CQRS EventSourcing library is based on Benjamin Eberlei's [LiteCQRS 
for php](https://github.com/beberlei/litecqrs-php) which was not maintained for 
quite a long time. This fork is bringing it back to life, but it is not to be 
considered as a stable library, since there may be BC breaks in the near 
future.

Main differences are:

- Minimal required version of PHP is 7.0, it will be 7.1 soon.
- Commanding - to the CommandBus you can register only implementations of 
ComandHandler (has only handle method). The reason behind this is to enforce 
explicitness in naming and structuring conventions. When you see XxxCommand and 
you need to see the implementation, you know there should be XxxCommandHandler 
implemented somewhere.


## Original updated readme

Small naming-convention based CQRS library for PHP (loosely based on [LiteCQRS for
C#](https://github.com/danielwertheim/LiteCQRS)) that relies on the MessageBus,
Command, EventSourcing and Domain Event patterns.

## Terminology

CQS is Command-Query-Separation: A paradigm where read methods never change
state and write methods never return data.  Build on top, CQRS suggests the
separation of read- from write-model and uses the [DomainEvent
pattern](http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/DomainEvent.html) to notify the read
model about changes in the write model.

Glow uses the command pattern and a central message bus service that
finds the corresponding handler to execute a command. A command must implement 
``Glow\Commanding\Command``. It should be a plain DTO (data transfer object) 
with just some properties describing it (imutability is encouraged).

After this object is passed as a parameter into the CommandBus' `handle(Command 
$command)` method, CommandBus finds a proper CommandHandler and invokes the 
same method with the same parameter on it. Enforced convention is that there 
has to be XxxCommandHandler (implementing CommandHandler) for every XxxCommand.

During the execution of a command, domain events can be triggered. These are
again just simple classes with some properties and they can optionally implement
``Glow\DomainEvent``.

An event queue knows what domain events have been triggered during a command
and then publishes them to an event message bus, where many listeners can
listen to them.

## Changes

## Conventions

* Each XxxCommand DTO is mapped to XxxCommandHandler when XxxCommand implements 
  Command and XxxCommandHandler implements CommandHandler.
* Domain Events are applied to Event Handlers "Event Class Shortname" =>
  "onEventClassShortname". An event listener is registered only if this matches.
* Domain Events are applied on Entities/Aggregate Roots "Event Class Shortname"
  => "applyEventClassShortname"
* You can optionally extend the ``DefaultDomainEvent`` which has a constructor
  that maps its array input to properties and throws an exception if an unknown
  property is passed.
* There is also a ``DefaultCommand`` with the same semantics as
  ``DefaultDomainEvent``. Extending this is not required.

Examples:

* ``GreetingCommand implements Command`` maps to the ``handle(GreetingCommand $command)`` method on the registered GreetingCommandHandler implementing CommandHandler.
* ``HelloWorld\GreetedEvent`` is passed to all event handlers that have a method ``onGreeted(GreetedEvent $event)``.
* ``HelloWorld\Events\Greeted`` is passed to all event handlers that have a method ``onGreeted(Greeted $event)``.
* ``HelloWorld\GreetedEvent`` is delegated to ``applyGreeted($event)`` when created on the aggregate root

## Installation & Requirements

Install with [Composer](http://getcomposer.org):

	composer require lidskasila/glow

## Workflow

These are the steps that a command regularly takes through the Glow stack during execution:

1. You push commands into a ``CommandBus``. Commands are simple objects
   implementing ``Command`` created by you.
2. The ``CommandBus`` checks for a handler that can execute your command. Every
   command has exactly one handler.
3. The command handler changes state of the domain model. It does so by
   creating events (that represent a state change) and passing them to the
   ``AggregateRoot::apply()`` or ``DomainEventProvider::raise()`` method of your domain objects.
4. When the command is completed, the command bus will check all objects in the
   identity map for events.
5. All found events will be passed to the ``EventMessageBus#publish()`` method.
6. The EventMessageBus dispatches all events to observing event handlers.
8. Event Handlers can create new commands again using the ``CommandBus``.

Command and Event handler execution can be wrapped in handlers that manage
transactions. Event handling is always triggered outside of any command
transaction. If the command fails with any exception all events created by the
command are forgotten/ignored. No event handlers will be triggered in this case.

In the case of InMemory CommandBus and EventMessageBus Glow makes sure that
the execution of commands and event handlers is never nested, but in sequential
linearized order. This prevents independent transactions for each command
from affecting each other.

## Examples

See [examples/](https://github.com/beberlei/litecqrs-php/tree/master/example) for
some examples:

1. ``example1.php`` shows usage of the Command- and EventMessageBus with one domain object
2. ``example2_event.php`` shows direct usage of the EventMessageBus inside a command
3. ``example3_sequential_commands.php`` demonstrates how commands are processed sequentially.
4. ``tictactoe.php`` implements a tic tac toe game with CQRS.
5. ``SymfonyExample.md`` shows ``example1.php`` implemented within the scope of a Symfony2 project.

## Setup

1. In Memory Command Handlers, no event publishing/observing

```php
<?php
$userService = new UserService();

$commandBus = new DirectCommandBus()
$commandBus->register('MyApp\ChangeEmailCommand', $userService);
```

2. In Memory Commands and Events Handlers

This uses ``Glow\EventProviderInterface`` instances to trigger domain events.

```php
<?php
// 1. Setup the Library with InMemory Handlers
$messageBus = new InMemoryEventMessageBus();
$identityMap = new SimpleIdentityMap();
$queue = new EventProviderQueue($identityMap);
$commandBus = new DirectCommandBus(array(
    new EventMessageHandlerFactory($messageBus, $queue)
));

// 2. Register a command service and an event handler
$userService = new UserService($identityMap);
$commandBus->register('MyApp\ChangeEmailCommand', $userService);

$someEventHandler = new MyEventHandler();
$messageBus->register($someEventHandler);
```

3. In Memory Commands + Custom Event Queue

Glow knows about triggered events by asking ``Glow\Bus\EventQueue``.
Provide your own implementation to be independent of
your domain objects having to implement ``EventProviderInterface``.

```php
<?php
$messageBus = new InMemoryEventMessageBus();
$queue = new MyCustomEventQueue();

$commandBus = new DirectCommandBus(array(
    new EventMessageHandlerFactory($messageBus, $queue)
));
```

## Usage

### To implement a Use Case of your application

1. Create a command object that receives all the necessary input values. Use public properties and extend ``Glow\DefaultCommand`` to simplify.
2. Add a new method with the name of the command to any of your services (command handler)
3. Register the command handler to handle the given command on the CommandBus.
4. Have your entities implement ``Glow\AggregateRoot`` or ``Glow\DomainEventProvider``
5. Use protected method ``raise(DomainEvent $event)`` or apply(DomainEvent $event)`` to attach
   events to your aggregate root objects.

That is all there is for simple use-cases.

If your command triggers events that listeners check for, you should:

1. Create a domain specific event class. Use public properties to simplify.
2. Create a event handler(s) or add method(s) to existing event handler(s).

While it seems "complicated" to create commands and events for every use-case. These objects are really
dumb and only contain public properties. Using your IDE or editor functionality you can easily generate
them in no time. In turn, they will make your code very explicit.

### Difference between apply() and raise()

There are two ways to publish events to the outside world.

- ``DomainEventProvider#raise(DomainEvent $event)`` is the simple one, it emits an event and does nothing more.
- ``AggregateRoot#apply(DomainEvent $event)`` requires you to add a method ``apply$eventName($event)`` that can be used to replay events on objects. This is used to replay an object from events.

If you don't use event sourcing then you are fine just using ``raise()`` and ignoring ``apply()`` altogether.


### Failing Events

The EventMessageBus prevents exceptions from bubbling up. To allow some debugging of failed event handler
execution there is a special event "EventExecutionFailed" that you can listen to. You will get passed
an instance of ``Glow\Bus\EventExecutionFailed`` with properties ``$exception``, ``$service`` and
``$event`` to allow analysing failures in your application.

## Extension Points

You should implement your own ``CommandBus`` or extend the existing to wire the whole process together
exactly as you need it to work.

## Plugins

### Symfony

Inside symfony you can use Glow by registering services with
``lite_cqrs.command_handler`` or the ``lite_cqrs.event_handler`` tag. These
services are then autodiscovered for commands and events.

Command- and Event-Handlers are lazily loaded from the Symfony Dependency
Injection Container.

To enable the bundle put the following in your Kernel:

```php
new \Glow\Plugin\SymfonyBundle\GlowBundle(),
```

You can enable/disable the bundle by adding the following to your config.yml:

    lite_cqrs: ~

Please refer to the [SymfonyExample.md](https://github.com/beberlei/litecqrs-php/blob/master/example/SymfonyExample.md)
document for a full demonstration of using Glow from within a Symfony2 project.

### Monolog

A plugin that logs the execution of every command and handler using
[Monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog).  It includes the type and name
of the message, its parameters as json and if its execution succeeded or failed.

The Monolog integration into Symfony registers a specific channel ``lite_cqrs``
which you can configure differently from the default channels in Symfony.  See
[the Symfony
cookbook](http://symfony.com/doc/master/cookbook/logging/channels_handlers.html)
for more information.
